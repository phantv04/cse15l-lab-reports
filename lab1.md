# CSE 15L Lab Report #1

___

*Using cd:*
1. No arguments

* There are no errors in the output because we did not state an argument for the command. Therefore, the reason why there is no output for this command is because there needs to be an argument so the code will know what to refer to. When the command was in run, the working directory was the lecture1 folder. 

2. Path to a directory

* There are no errors in the output because in the command line, we explicitly switched the current working directory to the given path. The reason for the results is that we have officially changed the directory, which is illustrated on the left side of the bottom line.  When the command was in run, there is no working directory yet. 

3. Path to a file

* There is an error in the output because once you have established your current working directory, the path to the directory should not be changed. Therefore, the reason for the output is because this command is attempting to change the directory to one that is already established in the code and the working directory in the code is lecture1. 

___

*Using ls:*
1. No arguments

* There are no errors in the output because we did not state an argument for ls. The output is lecture1 for this command is because normally, it shows the name of the folders and files inside the current working directory. However, a working directory will exist in the next step, but not this one. 
  
2. Path to a directory

* There are no errors in the output because in the command line, we stated the path to a directory using the ls command. The reason for the results is that ls lists the names of all the files and folders in the current working directory, which currently exists when we declared it to be lecture1.  Therefore, the current working directory is lecture1. 
  
3. Path to a file

* An error does not exist in the output because we clearly stated not just the current working directory, but also the file that we are trying to direct the path to. The reason for the output is because we listed the directory, folder, and file in the ls command, which basically lists the files in the given path. The current working directory in this case is also lecture1.
